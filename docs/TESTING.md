# Testing Enhanced Live Edit Capabilities

## What should work:

1. **Open Theme Editor**:
   - Command Palette: `Theme Editor: Open`
   - Should open a webview panel with the theme editor

2. **Live Editing**:
   - Change any color using the color picker
   - Changes should be throttled (150ms delay)
   - Multiple rapid changes should be batched
   - Visual feedback should appear for successful updates

3. **Search**:
   - Type in the search box
   - Results should be debounced (200ms delay)
   - Filtering should be smooth and responsive

4. **Batch Updates**:
   - Make multiple color changes quickly
   - Should see "Batch updated X colors" notification

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Invalid colors should show error feedback
   - Preview mode should work without permanent changes

## Test Steps:

1. Open VS Code with the extension loaded
2. Run `Theme Editor: Open` command
3. Try changing multiple colors quickly
4. Search for specific colors (e.g., "editor", "status")
5. Look for feedback notifications
6. Check VS Code updates in real-time

## Expected Behavior:

- Smooth, responsive UI with no lag
- Visual feedback for all operations
- Batched updates for better performance
- Real-time theme preview in VS Code
- Graceful error handling
