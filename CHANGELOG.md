## [2.5.1] - 2025-07-29

### üöÄ Major UX Overhaul: No More Disabled Items!
This release completely transforms how setting-dependent colors are handled, moving from a confusing "disabled" approach to helpful guidance that keeps all functionality accessible.

### Fixed
- **‚ùå Removed Item Disabling**: Items that require specific VS Code settings are no longer disabled
  - Removed `opacity: 0.4`, `pointer-events: none`, and `filter: grayscale(0.8)` from setting-dependent items
  - Removed control blurring with `filter: blur(1px)` that made controls unusable
  - All color controls are now fully interactive regardless of setting requirements
- **üéØ Clear Setting Requirements**: Dramatically improved visibility of which settings are needed
  - Setting badges now show gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) plus exact setting name (e.g., "‚öôÔ∏è editor.selectionHighlight")
  - Added prominent warning messages: "‚ö†Ô∏è Requires 'editor.selectionHighlight' to be enabled to take effect"
  - Enhanced setting mapping for common cases like breadcrumbs, minimap, title bar, and peek view settings

### Enhanced
- **üîó Better Setting Navigation**: Improved clickable setting badges for direct access
  - Click setting badges to open VS Code settings and search for the specific setting
  - Enhanced navigation mapping with more comprehensive setting relationships
  - Updated legend to reflect new "advisory" approach instead of "disabled" approach
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Visual Warning System**: Replaced disabling with helpful visual indicators
  - Orange left border on items that require settings (instead of graying out)
  - Styled warning messages with background highlights and clear typography
  - Normal hover states maintained for better interaction feedback
- **üìã Expanded Setting Coverage**: Added support for more setting-dependent features
  - Minimap colors: requires `editor.minimap.enabled`
  - Peek view colors: requires `editor.peekWidgetDefaultFocus`
  - Breadcrumb colors: requires `breadcrumbs.enabled`
  - Title bar colors: requires `window.titleBarStyle`
  - And many more comprehensive mappings

### Technical Improvements
- **üé® CSS Architecture**: Complete overhaul of setting-dependent styling
  - Removed all disabling CSS rules that blocked user interaction
  - Added `.setting-warning` class for consistent warning display
  - Enhanced hover states with warning-colored borders instead of blocking interaction
- **üîß Enhanced Functionality**: All features remain accessible with better guidance
  - Users can modify colors even if the setting isn't enabled yet
  - Clear guidance on exactly which setting to enable
  - Direct navigation to settings with one click
  - No more confusion about why items are disabled

### Benefits
- **üéØ Zero Functionality Loss**: Users can now modify any color regardless of setting state
- **üìñ Clear Guidance**: Exact setting names and requirements are always visible
- **üöÄ Better UX**: No more frustrating disabled controls - everything is accessible
- **üîç Enhanced Discovery**: Users learn about VS Code settings through helpful warnings instead of blocks
